# Architecture

Last synchronized: 2026-10-08.

## System In Brief

Venue Radar is versioned YAML plus Python generators and a self-contained static
HTML page. GitHub Pages publishes committed `docs/` from `main`. There is no
SQL database, backend, paid hosting or OpenAI API dependency. Python/PyYAML are
the required build tools; optional Node tools support workbook/branding/browser QA.

Repository: https://github.com/gon-uri/venue-radar
Website: https://gon-uri.github.io/venue-radar/

```text
reviewed YAML + local assets
        -> validate.py + Python tests
        -> build_all.py
        -> committed docs/index.html + ICS feeds
        -> GitHub Pages (main/docs)

YAML -> export_catalog.py -> sync_workbook.mjs -> review-only XLSX mirror
```

Organizer pages are reviewed by maintainers, not fetched by the website.
No map tiles, geocoder or organizer API is called at runtime. The optional,
lazily loaded Giscus client uses public GitHub Discussions; it is not a project
backend. No calendar/ranking/filter feature depends on it.

## Source Ownership

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `data/conferences.yml` | Edition identities, meeting dates, milestones, evidence, confidence, main display topics. |
| `data/topics.yml` | Stable controlled leaf vocabulary. |
| `data/topic_families.yml` | Eight-family IDs/names/order, leaf ownership and compact display labels. |
| `data/conference_families.yml` | One-to-three central family identities per exact series. |
| `data/conference_scopes.yml` | Sourced series prose, curated extra leaves and independent review date/year. |
| `data/cities.yml` | Exact location aliases and approximate city centers. |
| `data/icore_rankings.yml` | Direct current-release series ranks and official portal IDs/evidence. |
| `data/ccf_rankings.yml` | Direct series ranks, PDF/page evidence and separate navigation webpage. |
| `data/acceptance_rates.yml` | Historical track/year/percentage or sourced qualitative-only bands. |
| `data/metadata.yml` | Published dataset review date. |
| `data/core_conferences_normalized_tags.xlsx` | Latest-series catalog, vocabulary and scope review mirror; not canonical data. |
| `assets/` | Embedded site CSS/JS, logos, favicon, font, map geometry and vendor notices. |
| `docs/` | Generated public HTML and ICS only; never edit by hand. |
| `project_docs/` | Maintained handbook, evidence, decisions and session history. |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | Public conference request form. |
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | Python validation/tests/build CI. |

Each record is an edition; shared maps join by exact `series`. Ranks/rates/scopes
are not copied into each edition. See [data schema](data_schema.md) for fields
and [adding conferences](adding_conferences.md) for all companion updates.

## Code Ownership

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/validate.py` | Edition/rank/rate validation, date parsing, slugs, supported submission types and acceptance bands. Its CLI also validates families/cities/scopes. |
| `scripts/catalog_metadata.py` | Family/city and complete series-family validation; confirmed-city event payload. |
| `scripts/conference_scopes.py` | Profile validation, deduplicated topic union and missing/stale/prior-edition scope queue. |
| `scripts/build_ics.py` | Escaped/folded VCALENDAR output, stable ordering/UIDs, exact and all-day deadline events. |
| `scripts/build_site.py` | HTML/table/milestone generation and embedded core JavaScript for filters, submission-route selection, countdowns and sorting. |
| `assets/site.js` | Mobile-card initialization, family/leaf matching, offline map and optional Giscus loading; embedded by the site generator. |
| `assets/site.css` | Custom layout/brand/mobile styling, embedded alongside generator styles. |
| `scripts/build_all.py` | Validate source data, build ICS and standalone HTML. Run the standalone validator too; do not skip registry checks. |
| `scripts/maintenance_report.py` | Read-only edition, acceptance and scope review queues. |
| `scripts/rollover_editions.py` | Preview or explicitly append cadence-based estimates; never overwrites existing edition IDs. |
| `scripts/export_catalog.py` | JSON export of each series' latest edition, ranks/rates, vocabulary and profiles. |
| `scripts/sync_workbook.mjs` | Optional artifact-tool workbook synchronization, table/style preservation, checks and previews. |
| `scripts/recolor_logo.mjs`, `scripts/build_readme_banner.mjs` | Optional tools deriving brand outputs from immutable sources and the real title font. |
| `tests/test_*.py` | Unit/data/rendering/workflow/documentation regressions. |
| `tests/browser_smoke.mjs` and imported suites | Interactive desktop/mobile, route, map and overflow regressions using a frozen reference date. |

Do not assume every browser function lives in `assets/site.js`: core submission
logic is currently emitted inside `scripts/build_site.py`. Prefer existing
module boundaries; a documentation cleanup is not a reason to move behavior.

## Generated Outputs And Identity

- `docs/index.html`: standalone HTML with embedded local logo, radar favicon,
  Audiowide font, CSS/JS, pinned Leaflet and Natural Earth land geometry.
- `docs/calendar-all.ics`: meeting dates plus recorded deadlines.
- `docs/deadlines.ics`: recorded deadlines, including schedule-only steps.
- `docs/conferences.ics`: meeting dates only.
- `docs/tags/<leaf-slug>.ics`: topic-union events, not broad central-family feeds.
- `docs/conferences/<edition-id>.ics`: one edition's meeting and milestones.

All recorded milestones can enter ICS even if they are not fresh-submission
opportunities. The website's opportunities checkbox does not rewrite downloads.
Date-only cutoffs export all-day events. UTF-8 line folding and CRLF are
intentional; do not trim folded content spaces as cosmetic whitespace fixes.

Published edition IDs/deadline types determine UIDs. Keep the historical
`scientific-conference-calendar` namespace despite the repository rename.
Correct timing/source/labels in place without creating duplicate subscription
identities. Topic slugs and Giscus IDs/mapping are similarly durable.

## Current Browser Contracts

- Shared search, sizes, independent ICORE/CCF ranks, acceptance bands and topics
  filter both tabs and the map. OR applies within each metadata group; separate
  metadata groups combine with AND.
- Whole-family selection matches curated central identities; partial leaf
  selection matches the primary/additional union with OR within a family and
  ANY/ALL across selected families. Selecting every child equals the parent.
  Tables show at most four main topics; scope prose is searchable.
- Status, countdown and collapsed milestone share the same next required author
  action. Mandatory gates precede paper deadlines and can close that route.
  Organizer proposals, openings and production dates stay schedule-only.
  Exact status/evidence rules are in [data schema](data_schema.md#public-status-contract).
- Show submission options only defaults checked and includes open, scheduled,
  confirmed opening-unverified and estimated routes. It is deadlines-only.
  Clear filters removes every restriction, including that checkbox.
- At meeting start, the edition leaves Upcoming Deadlines and the future table;
  ongoing/past editions remain in a separate collapsible conference table.
  Map markers require confirmed/announced, mapped, non-online future meetings.
- Mobile is up to 760px: three fields plus independent More info disclosures;
  desktop keeps all columns. Filters start collapsed only on mobile. Resizing
  preserves the user's disclosure choices; no-JS retains full metadata access.
- Abstract-only publication formats use existing milestone/status wording and
  documented notes, not a new column or filter (ADR-036).

UI dimensions/colors and their approved history are covered by source assets,
regression tests and ADR-022/024/025/032-036, not repeated in every handbook file.
Selected copy lives in [site copy](site_copy.md) and [sharing](sharing.md).
Licensing: MIT code, CC BY 4.0 original content/artwork, preserved vendor notices.
Both licenses permit commercial reuse with their respective notices/attribution.

## Change And Publication Boundaries

Maintainers review official sources, edit owning YAML, update actual review
dates, synchronize mirrored fields, validate/test/build, inspect results and
commit source/output together when publishing. CI validates and rebuilds but
does not scrape sources, refresh evidence, enforce freshness, or commit its
build output. Pages serves the committed files, not CI's working copy.

Use [data maintenance](data_maintenance.md), [adding conferences](adding_conferences.md)
and [development](development.md) for commands and acceptance criteria. Current
state belongs in [implementation status](implementation_status.md), future work
in [roadmap](roadmap.md), rationale in [decisions](decisions.md), and actual
checks/outcomes in the newest [session entry](session_log.md). Follow
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the [documentation index](README.md), not a requirement
to read every historical proposal before a small change.
