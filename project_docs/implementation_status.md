# Implementation Status

Last synchronized: 2026-10-08. This is the current-state summary, not a release
history. Start with [the documentation index](README.md); historical counts and
prior designs remain in [decisions](decisions.md) and [session log](session_log.md).

## Current Snapshot

| Item | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `gon-uri/venue-radar`; GitHub Pages publishes `main/docs`. |
| Website | https://gon-uri.github.io/venue-radar/ |
| Architecture | Reviewed YAML + Python generators + standalone static HTML/ICS; no backend or SQL database. |
| Catalog | 166 edition records across 129 distinct series. Website row counts refer to editions, not unique series. |
| Topics | Eight unchanged families; 43 controlled leaves; one-to-three central identities per series. |
| Detailed scopes | 79 reviewed profiles; 50 series still lack a reviewed profile. |
| Evidence maps | 66 direct ICORE 2026 ranks, 55 direct CCF 2026 ranks, 34 historical rate/qualitative-band entries. |
| Public feeds | 212 ICS files: three aggregates, 43 leaf-topic feeds and 166 edition feeds. |
| Review mirror | XLSX catalog/vocabulary/scope tables synchronized from YAML. |
| Licensing | MIT code, CC BY 4.0 original content/artwork, preserved third-party notices. |

Counts are a dated catalog snapshot. Recompute them from canonical files after
additions, not from an older session entry or a filtered website screenshot.

## Implemented Behavior

- Two views: Upcoming Deadlines and Conferences & Map, with future editions
  ordered by meeting date and ongoing/past editions separately accessible.
- Status, countdown and collapsed milestone identify the same next eligible
  contribution action, including mandatory abstract/registration gates.
  Open, scheduled and confirmed opening-unverified opportunities are green;
  estimated opportunities yellow, closed red, unannounced grey. Closed rows
  say Closed, not time until camera-ready. Expanded schedules retain other steps.
- Show submission options only defaults checked, is deadlines-only and includes
  the four eligible states. Clear filters removes all restrictions, even when
  the panel is collapsed. See [the status contract](data_schema.md#public-status-contract).
- Shared topics, search, sizes, independent ICORE/CCF and acceptance filters
  affect both views/map. Whole families use central identities; individual
  leaves use curated main/additional topics. Tables keep four main tags.
- Historical rates have source/year/track context and five bands. Missing
  evidence remains Unknown; ranks are independent, not predicted acceptance.
- Confirmed/announced future, non-online meetings in known cities appear on an
  offline Leaflet/Natural Earth map. Estimates remain in tables, not the map.
- Filters open by default above 760px and close initially on mobile. Mobile
  cards show three fields and independently expand More info; desktop tables
  stay complete. Disclosure state survives filters/tabs/resizing; no-JS keeps
  full metadata accessible. Mobile visual refinement is covered by ADR-035.
- Venue Radar branding uses the selected Audiowide title, four-color calendar/
  radar PNG, radar-only favicon, restrained teal styling and semibold names.
  Source assets, notices and optical-alignment regressions are maintained.
- Header actions are Share on X, Star the repo and All events (.ics), with the
  download caption below. Neither social action posts/stars automatically.
  Per-edition downloads remain in Conferences & Map, not deadline rows.
- Giscus uses verified repository/category IDs and the stable discussion term;
  GitHub issue links work independently. Public README stays nontechnical,
  credits Gonzalo Uribarri and includes the personal-project clarification.

Exact selected wording is owned by [site copy](site_copy.md) and
[sharing](sharing.md); field semantics by [data schema](data_schema.md), not
historical prose in a design proposal.

## Maintenance Is Ready, Not Automatic

[Data maintenance](data_maintenance.md) explains the read-only monthly edition,
rate and scope queues, official-source review and confidence handling.
Cadence-aware rollover previews estimates for an explicit allowlist; `--write`
requires review and never overwrites existing editions. There is no unattended
source scraping, freshness enforcement or automatic data promotion.

[Adding conferences](adding_conferences.md) covers identity/approval, all owning
files, taxonomy, dates, publication caveats and verification. [Development](development.md)
covers Python setup, standalone validation, tests, builds, XLSX synchronization,
browser checks and publication. Optional Node tools are not website/build dependencies.

The onboarding audit adds a task index, field/addition guides and six automated
documentation checks. All 87 Python tests pass; a full rebuild preserves every
public artifact and canonical/mirrored data value. See the newest session entry.

## Open Editorial Work

- Review future estimates and stale checks against current official CFPs about
  monthly. Validation confirms structure/provenance presence, not factual accuracy.
- Complete the 50 missing scope profiles gradually; curate characteristic
  categories, never exhaustive CFP inventories or guessed specialist coverage.
- Add rank/rate mappings only from direct supported evidence. Workshops, joint
  editions and similarly named conferences must not inherit a different venue's rank.
- Resolve ICCN's conflicting 2026 dates and the next NODYCON/Dynamics Days
  Asia-Pacific/Dynamics Days CAC announcements. Their gaps are deliberately
  retained in the review queue rather than converted into false future dates.
- Revisit unannounced ALIFE/BCI/SfN calls and BioCAS's exact paper route;
  preserve abstract-only versus full-paper publication notes without changing UI.
- Keep the original AI Deadlines backlog dated: 42 approved additions, 15 still
  deferred, and future-only ICWM separate. Candidates are not approved calendar data.
- Refresh ranking release schemas and evidence together if publishers issue a
  new list. Expand rate evidence only with defensible historical track statistics.

Detailed edition caveats are in [the evidence documents](README.md#evidence-and-design-records)
and [roadmap](roadmap.md). Further venue additions and UI/taxonomy changes still
follow the user's approved scope.

## Verification Baseline

Catalog release `8b351a3` passed 81 Python tests, the full browser suite at
1440/1051/1050/768/390/320px, workbook re-import/render checks, deterministic
builds and ICS CRLF/folding/UID checks. Every existing event in the prior 187
feeds and all 144 prior edition records stayed unchanged. Build `37794093622`
and Pages `37794090302` passed; live HTML and all 28 aggregate/new feeds matched
local output and live browser smoke passed. Documentation follow-up `63ccda5`
changed no data, assets, scripts, tests or generated outputs.

New checks and publication results belong in the newest session entry. Do not
infer a fresh source review from this historical verification baseline.
